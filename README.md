**Project Title**: AI Anime Recommender

**Project Description**:
Uses Ollama to manage API requests and allow users to make recommendation requests
for anime to watch based off of selected user criteria.

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make sure all dependencies are up to date
2. Begin running an instance of the app's language model on Ollama
3. Run the app on flutter through your IDE

Instructions for using the software:

1. Select the genres you want via the checkboxes

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:
